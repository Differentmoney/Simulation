This program carwash.py accepts commandline arguments for the parameters of the carwash. After taking in the user inputs from the command line, the program will then proceed to run the carwash simulation. Once the simulation is complete the resulting data for the car line length throughout the course of the simulation is then plotted in the form of a line graph using matplotlib. 
Implementation of a Poisson distribution for the time interval at which cars arrive at the car wash.

List of completed items:
- Poisson distribution
- Something interesting: one faster machine vs two less expensive machine
- Video demoing simulation
- Source code carwash.py
- Report covering the analysis of the simulation data and results.
